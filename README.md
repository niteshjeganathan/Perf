# Perf

## What is Perf? 
* Perf is a profiler tool for Linux based systems
* Abstracts away all hardware differences in Linux performance measurements
* Simple commandline interface

## Commands
* Can collect and analyze performance and trace data
```bash
perf

  usage: perf [--version] [--help] [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]

 The most commonly used perf commands are:
   annotate        Read perf.data (created by perf record) and display annotated code
   archive         Create archive with object files with build-ids found in perf.data file
   bench           General framework for benchmark suites
   buildid-cache   Manage build-id cache.
   buildid-list    List the buildids in a perf.data file
   c2c             Shared Data C2C/HITM Analyzer.
   config          Get and set variables in a configuration file.
   daemon          Run record sessions on background
   data            Data file related processing
   diff            Read perf.data files and display the differential profile
   evlist          List the event names in a perf.data file
   ftrace          simple wrapper for kernel's ftrace functionality
   inject          Filter to augment the events stream with additional information
   iostat          Show I/O performance metrics
   kallsyms        Searches running kernel for symbols
   kvm             Tool to trace/measure kvm guest os
   list            List all symbolic event types
   mem             Profile memory accesses
   record          Run a command and record its profile into perf.data
   report          Read perf.data (created by perf record) and display the profile
   script          Read perf.data (created by perf record) and display trace output
   stat            Run a command and gather performance counter statistics
   test            Runs sanity tests.
   top             System profiling tool.
   version         display the version of perf binary
   probe           Define new dynamic tracepoints

 See 'perf help COMMAND' for more information on a specific command.
```

## Events
* Events refer to specific occurrence or conditions that perf can monitor and analyze
* These events help track CPU performance, memory usage, context switches, cache hits/misses, and many other system metrics.

Different types of events are: 
* Software Events
  * Pure kernel counters
  * These are generated by the Linux kernel rather than the hardware.
  * Example: context switches
* Hardware Events (PMU hardware events)
  * These are events directly provided by the CPUâ€™s Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU).
  * Vary with each processor type and model
  * Example: number of cycles
* PMU Events / Hardware Cache Events
  * More detailed, CPU-specific events accessible via hardware counters.
  * These events get mapped onto an actual events provided by the CPU
  * Confusingly called hardware events as well
  * Exmaple: LLC-loads
* Tracepoint Events
  * Implemented by kernel ftrace infrastructure
  * Kernel-defined tracepoints for monitoring specific kernel events.
  * Example: syscalls:sys_enter_execve: Triggers when a process executes a new binary

 To get a list of supported evenets: 
 ```bash
$ perf list
